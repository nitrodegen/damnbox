very crappy sandbox

<p>
this sandbox was built by me , for practice purpouses, just posting it here so that i can remember what a shit code this was.<br>
<b>it checks these syscalls:</b>
<ul><em>-write
<br><em>-read
<br><em>-mmap
<br><em>-execve
<br><em>-open

<hr>
<h2>do not take this code seriously. i might actually implement a good sandbox for my next project. this is just to see what i would do.</h2>
